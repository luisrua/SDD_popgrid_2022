## Population Grids for the Pacific Community countries

### What?
Production of gridded population datasets tailored for the Pacific Community countries using the most recent census (or listing) data available.
### Why?
1.	New population data available (VUT, TON, NRU, MHL, KIR, COK, TUV (listing))
2.	New and higher resolution building footprints available, we were using Facebook/Meta high resolution population grids to fill gaps but now there are newer and better alternatives that can be implemented. (GHSL, WorldPop,
3.	We can better organize the whole project (Rscripts, data input and documentation) which will represent a huge improvement. Maybe implementing project using Git.
4.	Once we have the population grids arranged, we could then work on Coastal Population, LECZ and Urban Rural analysis.
